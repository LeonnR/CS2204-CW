            <p>Welcome to Hong Kong Industrial University -- a dynamic and innovative
                institution committed to providing high-quality education and researchcod
                opportunities for students from Hong Kong and worldwide. Since our
                establishment in 1997, we have been dedicated to becoming a small-scale,
                high-level, and international university oriented toward research and
                innovation.</p>
            <p> Our campus covers an area of approximately 500 hectares. It is located in
                the Hong Kong Kowloon High-Tech Park, where we collaborate closely with
                institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Our faculty comprises
                renowned scholars and experts from home and abroad who are committed to
                providing students with cutting-edge knowledge and skills in 11
                disciplines, including Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Materials Science and
                Engineering, Electronic Science and Technology, Cognitive Science,
                Computer Science and Technology, Biomedical Engineering, Electronics and
                Information Technology, Materials, and Chemical Engineering, and Biology
                and Medicine.</p>
            <p> At Hong Kong Industrial University, we offer a student-centered
                educational approach that encourages cross-disciplinary research in an
                international environment. Our curriculum is based on international
                standards and is taught entirely in English. We encourage undergraduate
                students to join research groups from their first year, with approximately
                82% of our undergraduate students joining research groups by their third
                year and 100% by their final year. To broaden our students' international
                perspectives, we provide them various overseas study opportunities,
                including at world-renowned universities such as Harvard University,
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tsinghua University, City
                University of Hong Kong, and Peking University.</p>
